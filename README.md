SafeBeacon is an app designed to help make traveling safer, less stressful, and more informed for our customers. We have three ways to do this. First, we have hardware that detects when our users are in a car accident and alerts the authorities if the user doesnâ€™t respond to a prompt on their phone within a short time. The second aspect is a crime/accident reporting that lets the users report and see reports from other users so they about crimes and accidents in their area, as well as crime stats from the local PD. The last part of the software is that it will give our users a step by step guide to how to handle getting in a small car accident so that we can take some of the stress out of a stressful situation.

### This is an android application built with Android Studio and Raspberry Pi.
### Database is built in Firebase.
